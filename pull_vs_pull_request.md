​5. Difference between Pull, PR, and Push (pull_vs_pull_request.md)
​Push: Sending your local committed changes to the remote server.
​Pull: Bringing changes from the server down to your local computer.
​Pull Request: Not a Git command, but a GitHub feature for reviewing and discussing code before it gets merged into the official project.
